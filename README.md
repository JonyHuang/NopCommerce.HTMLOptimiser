##HTML Optimiser nopCommerce plugin

The HTML Optimiser plugin allows you to do the following things:
- Minify the HTML output by removing unnecessary whitespace and line breaks.  
  Depending on your theme and content this can reduce your HTML download size by up to 30%.
- Remove unwanted HTTP reponse headers (for example: X-Powered-By, X-AspNet-Version).
- Add extra HTTP response headers (for example: X-Frame-Options).

All this is possible without having to configure or have access to IIS.

###Compatibility
This plugin is compatible with nopCommerce v3.40 (v1.2), v3.30 (v1.1) and v3.20 (v1.0).

If you require a version of the plugin that is compatible with an older version of nopCommerce, feel free to get in touch.
